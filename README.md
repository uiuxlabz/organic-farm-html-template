# 🌿 FarmFresh — Organic Farm & Produce Template

**One-line pitch:** A sun-washed, hand-grown HTML template for organic farms, farm shops and CSA programs — pure HTML, CSS and vanilla JS with zero frameworks.

FarmFresh is a complete 10-page marketplace-ready website for a family-owned organic farm. It celebrates honest food, healthy soil and community — with a warm linen-and-leaf aesthetic, heirloom photography, and every interaction built by hand. Drop it on any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) and it works as-is.
